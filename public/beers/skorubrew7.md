I've already got my malt for this but I'm thinking of adding the juice from an Apple to make this a Toffee Apple Ale

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Quick oats 150g
* Toffee Malt 200g
* Juice from 2 apples
* Half packet of US-05 Yeast
* 10g cascade
* 5g citra

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water
* Heat 4L of water to 70 degrees
* Cook oats separately in the microwave so they don't clump when added to the mash
* Slowly add the malt into the bag while stirring to prevent clumping
* Cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* Add Apple juice
* Add flameout hops (10g citra)
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Wait for fermentation
* Leave in the fermenter until fermentation settles down
* Once fermentation has settled down add dry hops (10g citra)
* Wait 3 days

Hop Schedule
-------------

* 5g cascade @ 10 minutes
* 5g cascade @ 55 minutes
* 5g citra dry hop

Brewday 16-05-2016
----------

* Getting the juice out of apples was harder than expected so I didn't really put much in and am not sure how much effect it's going to have
* Gravity reading was 1.065 (16 brix)

Bottling 05-06-2016
---------

* Tried a new filter. Seemed to filter well but took too long to strain
* Refractometer reading was 8.7 brix

Tasting 7.5 /10
--------

There’s a slight caramel/toffee flavour that comes through but the apple isn’t there except for the smell. More bitter than my other beers but it’s not overwhelming

Updates
-------

* 18-05-2016 05:00 Fermentation was going so strong I could hear it in the other room. Temp was at 25 so I put some ice bricks in
* 02-06-2016 10:00 Added 5g citra dry hop. The beer smells fruity
