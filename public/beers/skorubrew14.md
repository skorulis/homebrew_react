The weather is warming up so moving back to the M27 yeast. Thinking about doing a fairly plain belgian ale but with a little bit of a fruit addition via apple juice.

Tasting 7.5 /10

Really rounded flavour. Much less hoppy than my other brews and the slight apple tang adds something that you wouldnâ€™t normally see. The high ABV adds another element. Overall a decent and unique beer

Updates
-----

* 26-11-2016 - Reading of 7 brix, 7.1% ABV. Smells very hoppy
* 26-11-2016 - Dry hopped beer
* 30-11-2016 - Bottled the beer. Smelled amazing at first but not so great after it oxidised. Tasted okish, hoping it improves a bit in the bottle
