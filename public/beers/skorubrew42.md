Trying to make a simple brown ale

Scales are still broken, so guessing hop measurements. 


Grain Bill
-----

* 1KG Maris otter
* 100g roasted barley

Hop Schedule
-------------

* 8g East kent goldings at 40 minutes


Notes
------

* Heated the water up to 74 degrees with the expectation that the grain would drop it below 70
* Was hard to get it down to the right yeast temp
* Tried out putting yeast on top without shaking and not using as much. Will see how that turns out
* Fermentation was going by the next day, temp was still at 26, added some ice bricks to see if I could bring it down
