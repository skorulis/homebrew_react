Notes
------

* Had to add some more heat during the mash because the water temp dropped too much from the grain
* Used a heat pad during the mash but temperature dropped to mid 60s by the end
* Quite a lot of boil off so topped up with some chilled water to help cool the wort and then some more from the tap to get to 4.5L
