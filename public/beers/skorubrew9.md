A very similar beer to #3 with the addition of a little lactose and flour. Flour because I wanted to experiment with it and lactose because I need to find some use for it outside of stouts.

* Mixed the flour in with the oats before giving it a quick microwave. Seemed to cause the oats to clump a little bit when added to the mash
* Tried a new method of squeezing the bag by putting it in a colander and pushing down with a bowl. Much less messy but not sure if it gets the same efficiency as using my hands.
* Put the lactose in with about 20 minutes left on the boil
* Gravity came in at lower than 3 despite the addition of more ingredients

Bottling 04-07-2016
-------------

* Final reading of 8 brix
* Smells and tastes pretty good

Tasting 6.5/10
--------

A little over carbonated with no head retention but still a tasty drop. Fairly easy drinking with just a mild hop flavour. Has a sweet finish that takes away the bitterness.

Updates

* 01-07-2016 17:00 Was about to bottle when I realised I hadn't even done a dry hop yet. Added 5g citra with the plan of bottling on monday
