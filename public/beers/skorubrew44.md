My new fermenter came with an premix wort so using that up because why not. 

Seems that I've actually been given ingredients for 2 different beers, but not much can be done about that and maybe it will even come out better.

The  wort itself smelled more salty than it normally would, not sure how long those cans have been sitting around. I decided not to use the supplied yeast in case in had gone bad.

The amount of sugars in the wort was much lower than normal for my beers so I expect this one to be pretty weak.
