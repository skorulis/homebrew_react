Tasting 6 /10
--------

Very much a Belgian ale. Not too bitter and very low on hop flavour. Not very pretty. Probably a good winter beer, sadly I brewed it in the summer

Updates
-------

* 09-01-2017 - Bottling went smoothly. Bottles have less headspace than normal and I tried to keep the tube near the bottom to reduce oxygen introduction. Turned out to be my lowest final gravity so far.
