After many years of drinking beer I finally decided to take a spin at making it myself so I went out and got myself a 5L brew kit

For my first ever homebrew I stuck to using a [5L pale ale recipe](http://www.thehopandgrain.com.au/product/5l-pale-ale-extract-recipe/) which although a prepackaged kit still got me to go through the entire process.

Ingredients
--------

* 80g grain
* 540g malt extract
* 2x 20g hop pellets packet
* 1/2 campden tablet
* 15g sodium percarbonate 
* 5.5L tap water

method
-------

* Sterilise pot, carboy, bung and airlock using sodium percarbonate solution
* Add half a campden tablet to some warm water in a cup and crush
* Add this solution to 5.5 L of cold water and sit for 10 minutes

* Take 1L of the water and heat to 70 degrees
* Add grains to the water and cover for 30 minutes
* Strain out spent grain and add back to the remaining water
* Add 180g of the malt extract
* Bring the liquid to a gentle boil

* Add first hop packet (Start a timer here)
* After 50 minutes add the remaining malt extract and the second hop packet
* After 60 minutes remove from the boil and add to a sink of cold water
* When the liquid has cooled add to the carboy
* Make sure the temperature is below 25 degrees
* Add yeast to carboy
* Cover the bung and gently invert a few times
* Add sanitising solution to the airlock and put in the bung


The colour came out looking a little bit brown and not exactly appetising but I'm hoping that this improves after bottling

It certainly didn't start to look any better once fermentation started

Bottling 29-02-2016

![End of fermenting](assets/IMG_1068.JPG)

Siphoned out of the fermenter using just a hose into 12 330ml bottles. Added a measure of castor sugar to each bottle. At 1.020 the final gravity seemed way too high but it had been fermenting for 2 weeks so there wasn't much else to do. If bottles start exploding I'll simply have to uncap and recap them.

The beer tasted a little bit sour and lacking much malt or hop flavour. I'm thinking #1 could be a failure and may end up way too fizzy. Will have to wait 2 weeks to find out


Tasting {{ page.rating }} /10
--------

* Opened my first bottle on 07-03-2016 and it wasn't as bad as I thought. It smells better than when bottled but still has a slight sour/cider smell. Luckily this doesn't affect the taste much. The malt flavour is a bit strong for my liking and there's very little hop profile is missing. It's a little more bitter than I would like but it's not too bad.


Updates
------

* 14-02-2016 21:00 Fermentation has started
* 15-02-2016 09:00 The temperature was at 27 degrees which is hotter than I wanted it and it's bubbling rapidly. Added some ice to the bath to try and bring the temperature down
* 16-02-2016 09:00 Fermentation has slowed considerably, adding ice bricks yesterday has pulled the temperature down to 25.
* 16-02-2016 09:00 Temperature holding at 25
* 19-02-2016 09:00 Temperature is down to 22. Fermentation seems to be complete
* 23-02-2016 20:00 Temperature is holding at 24. Somehow fermentation is still going. Letting the temp increase a bit to hopefully speed it up.
