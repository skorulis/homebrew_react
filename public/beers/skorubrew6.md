Still deciding exactly what to do on this one. I've got my grain already and am thinking of doing something similar to #3 but with more oats and hops to make a stronger hoppier beer. This could be the first beer that I call an IPA.

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Quick oats 150g
* Brown sugar 50g
* Cascade hops 10g
* Citra hops 25g
* Half packet of US-05 Yeast

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water
* Heat 4L of water to 70 degrees
* Cook oats separately in the microwave so they don't clump when added to the mash
* Slowly add the malt into the bag while stirring to prevent clumping
* Cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Add brown sugar
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter
* After 10 minutes add 5g cascade
* After 30 minutes add 5g cascade
* After 50 minutes add 5g citra
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* Add flameout hops (10g citra)
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Wait for fermentation
* Leave in the fermenter until fermentation settles down
* Once fermentation has settled down add dry hops (10g citra)
* Wait 3 days

----------

* Forgot to put the flameout hops in until the wort had almost completely cooled. Almost as if I've put in some very early dry hops. Oops
* Gravity reading was 1.059 (14.2 brix)

Bottling 23-05-2016
----------

* Refractometer reading was 8 brix which means the FG is 1.015 making this a 5.8% beer
* The smell coming off this while bottling was amazing. Really strong citrus and apple. Can't wait to taste it
* Sadly there was only enough for 10.5 bottles. Going to add more water to the next batch to get an extra bottle

Tasting 7 /10
--------

A little underwhelmed with the hop flavour, it didn’t come out as strong as I expected. While I wouldn’t really call this an IPA it’s still a nice beer. Not too bitter and really easy to drink.
