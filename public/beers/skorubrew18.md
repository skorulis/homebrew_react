* 500g wheat malt


Hop Schedule
-------------

* 1g Willamette @ 50 minutes
* 1g Willamette @ 40 minutes

Method
-------

* Mash at 70C for 1 hour
* Batch sparge with water 70-75C
* Bring to boil and leave for 1 hour

Tasting 6 /10
--------

Has a beautiful hazy golden color. Starts off a bit yeasty but that fades quickly. Almost no lingering bitterness and there's a slight tangy flavour but there's just too something that seems wrong

Updates
-------

* 2017-01-10 - The brew bubbled straight through the airlock. Surprised considering how little sugar was involved but I guess the mead yeast is just a beast.
