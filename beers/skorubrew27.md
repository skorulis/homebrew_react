Trying to build something full of hop flavours.


Grain Bill
-----

1.1kg munich malt
100g toffee malt
100g caramalt
100g acid malt


Hop Schedule
-------------

* 5g amarillo spread over 10 minute intervals starting at 60 minutes
* 8g mosaic spread over 10 minute intervals starting at 60 minutes
* 10g amarillo dry hop


Method
-------

* Batch sparge with water  < 70C
* Bring to boil and leave for 1 hour


Updates
-------

* Had just a little mosaic left in the packet so I adjusted the hop quantities a little bit.
