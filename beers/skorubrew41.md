Going to try out putting some hops directly on top of the mash, even though the pellets will be removed it's likely some  oils will remain.

Heated the water to 73, it  was hard to get a good temperature read after that

Scales are broken, so guessing hop measurements.


Grain Bill
-----

* 1KG Pilsner 2 row
* 300g wheat malt
* 100g crystal 40

Hop Schedule
-------------

* 2g Galaxy in the mash
* 2g Galaxy at 10 minutes
* 2g Galaxy at 20 minutes
* 2g Galaxy at 30 minutes
* 2g Galaxy at 40 minutes
* 4g Citra dry hop


Notes
------

* Heated the water up to 74 degrees with the expectation that the grain would drop it below 70
