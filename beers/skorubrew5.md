After tossing up between using honey, making another dark beer and using a different yeast I landed on using a Belgian yeast to make a Belgian pale ale. After some advice from my LHBS I decided to add 300g of Vienna malt into the #3 recipe. 

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Vienna malt 300g
* Quick oats 150g
* Cascade hops 5g @ 50 minutes
* Cascade hops 5g @ flameout
* Citra hops 5g @ flameout
* Citra hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g dry hop
* Mangrove Jacks Belgian yeast M27

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water
* Heat 4L of water to 70 degrees
* Cook oats separately in the microwave so they don't clump when added to the mash
* Slowly add the malt into the bag while stirring to prevent clumping
* Cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter
* After 10 minutes hops
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* Add flameout hops
* While chilling create a whirlpool to concentrate the particulate in the centre of the kettle
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Wait for fermentation
* Leave in the fermenter until fermentation settles down
* Once fermentation has settled down add dry hops
* Wait 3 days

----------

* Gradually pouring in the grain prevented in clumping quite well.
* Forgot to take out 2L of water so I guess this is a full volume BIAB. Ended up pouring some more cold water to get a bit more out of the grain
* Ended up adding cascade hops at flameout as I probably need to use them faster
* OG came in much lower than expected at 1.058 (14 Brix). Guessing the full volume BIAB wasn't good for efficiency
* My volumes this time were spot on. Probably helped covering the kettle as it cooled so not as much water could escape

Bottling 11-05-2016
-----------
* This time to reduce the amount of gunk in the bottle I tried a funnel with a chux cloth. Got a little bit of the gunk out of the bottle and made me feel better about getting out the last drops. Still only got 11 bottles
* Reading was 6.1 brix meaning the FG is 1.010 and the alcohol will be 6.4% after bottling
* The smell at this stage is amazing but the taste seems a little off. It definitely has a belgian tinge but has a strong alcohol taste. Has a nice aftertaste though. Will have to wait and see how this turns out

Tasting 6 /10
--------

Definitely tastes like a belgian ale. Not the favourite beer I've made but it's ok.

Updates
-------
* 24-04-2016 23:00 Fermentation has already started. Much faster than with US-05. Hopefully it doesn't bubble over during the night
* 26-04-2016 10:15 Fermentation has slowed. Temp is 24C. Currently looking very bright yellow
* 05-05-2016 20:30 Added the dry hops and 6 marbles. Took a reading and got 6 brix which would be 6.36% alcohol which is higher than expected. Not sure if that reading was correct. When I took the carboy out of the cupboard it looked like it had stopped fermenting but the agitation seemed to kick it off again. Smelled a bit yeasty but in a more Belgian way. This yeast may need more time to condition than US05
* Dry hops still floated to the top. Not sure how many marbles it would take to keep it down
