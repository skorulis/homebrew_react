This is definitely going to be another stout since I've gotten quite a lot of interest there. Thinking of making this a chocolate milk stout.

* Cocoa powder 5g
* Half a vanilla pod

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water

* Cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter

----------

* Forgot to separate sparge water out so did a full volume mash. PH was ~7
* Simply chopped the vanilla pod in half and threw it in after flameout. Put it in the primary after that
* The fermenter is a lot fuller than I normally do. Hoping it doesn't spill over
* For some reason the dry yeast didn't seem to want to dissolve and kept floating on top. Shook it a lot but there were still some floating

* Final reading of 10.5 brix
* The beer smells a little bit smokey tastes quite bitter despite still having a lot of sugar. Don't think this is going to end up tasting that nice

Tasting 7.5 /10
--------

A much more in your face stout than my earlier one.
