Trying to make a slightly biscuity brown ale but after mashing it was a lot paler than expected, so I thought it might end up as a pale ale, but after the boil it's back to brown. No idea what this beer wants to be.

Scales are still broken, so guessing hop measurements. 

The amount of steam from the boil was putting a bit too much humidity in the house so I had to cut the boil off a little bit early.

* Not sure why this went into the fermenter with so much sediment.
