#3 is going to be done very similar to #2 just with the addition of oats and slightly later hop additions.

1. Add flaked oats to see how that turns out
1. Adjust the hops based on how #2 tastes. Probably put the bittering hops in a little later
1. I'm also going to get some pH strips and potentially drop it down since I feel it might be too high currently

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Quick oats 100g
* Citra hops 5g @ flameout
* Citra hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g @ 50 minutes
* Safale american ale yeast (US-05)

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water
* Heat 4L of water to 70 degrees
* Place malt and oats in a bag and cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter
* After 10 minutes add 5g cascade hops
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* At flameout add 5g citra hops
* While chilling create a whirlpool to concentrate the particulate in the centre of the kettle
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Wait for fermentation
* Leave in the fermenter for 4 weeks
* Once fermentation has settled down add 5g of citra and 5g cascade to dry hop

* When I added the oats they all clumped together so I had to do a lot of stirring to fix that which lost quite a bit of temperature requiring the heat to be put back on the bring it back up. But the bag and malt seemed to interfere with the water currents causing the bottom to sound like it was boiling while the temperature was still regeresting 65. Measuring the temp at the bottom gave 74. I left the lid off and gave it a bit of a swirl to try an help but the final mash temperature ended up at 62 which was not ideal
* I tried to take my mash pH but it's outside the range of my strips to check which makes it too high but there's not too much to be done about it
* This time I gave the malt bag a much better squeeze in the hope of getting more sugars out
* Almost forgot to add the second hops at flameout. The wort smell really good after the addition
* Original gravity came in much higher than #2 at 1.053 (13 brix)
* The addition of oats left me with a lot of trub in the fermenter. I don't think I'm going to get 12 bottles out of this one

Bottling 10-04-2016
-------------------

Having the loose hops made it difficult to prevent gunk ending up in the bottles, don't think I'll try that again. The beer again tastes a bit green and less hoppy than I was expecting. I thought the extra time fermenting would have reduced the greeness and the 10g of hops would have added more of a hop smell. The oats seem to have given it a more syrupy texture leading me to think that this will end up being a smooth easy drinking beer.

Tasting 7 /10
--------

Pretty good all round. Has a nice sweetness which balances well against the slight citrus hop profile 

Updates
-------

* 13-03-2016 09:00 Fermentation has started. The yeast activity has stirred things up and it looks like brown sludge. Temp at 24C
* 15-03-2016 01:30 Fermentation appears to have stopped
* 07-04-2016 09:30 Got back from holidays and the beer is looking very dark. Not sure what's happened while I was away
* 07-04-2016 10:30 Dumped in my dry hops. This time just with the pellets directly into the fermenter. The pellets dissolved quite quickly but remained floating on top
