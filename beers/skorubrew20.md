Brewing a lighter beer good for warmer weather. Forgot to split my mash water so I ended up doing a full volume mash which meant my small amount of lemon juice wasn't going to bring the pH down. Also tried out using a hop sock in the brew for less gunk in the fermenter

Love the colour I got with this one but not much else. A really yeast driven beer and perhaps too much for my taste.
